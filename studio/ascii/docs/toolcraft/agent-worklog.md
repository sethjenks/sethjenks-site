# Implementation Worklog

## Status

Mode: product

ASCII Journal Studio is a local Toolcraft workspace that turns a dropped image or Paper inbox export into an ink-on-paper Geist Mono plate with Cipher-like marks, a 3s playback loop, and assign-to-post as a live plate, looping video, or still. It has no layers or public route. The default plate is 672×336, matching the journal column.

## Current pass — Inks, mark set, and source frame

Verification tier: Tier 3
Reason: This pass adds growable ink swatches, per-kind mark switches, and source framing on top of the shipped plate kernel. It is a post-first-working feature loop, not a fresh product.
Run: `npm run verify:quick`, targeted schema/acceptance/unit tests, and controlled-browser checks of studio inks, mark switches, and frame drag plus a journal plate fallback.
Skip: Full verify:perf is not required for this post-first-working feature loop; targeted animation and export scenarios are declared.

### Control Section Inventory

- Source: `source.image` uses the built-in image `fileDrop` for one dropped, pasted, or selected inbox image.
- Frame: `frame.zoom` close-crops the source so pan has slack.
- Offset: `frame.offset` is the standalone vector; the center pin writes the same target.
- Illustration: `ascii.columns`, `ascii.preset`, `ascii.characters`, `ascii.contrast`, and `ascii.invert` control the glyph renderer.
- Mark set: seven kind switches filter the shape bank. An empty bank paints ticks.
- Marks: `marks.mix`, `marks.weight`, `marks.edges`, `marks.flecks`, `marks.smears`, `marks.seed`, and `marks.reshuffle` mix the enabled shapes into the grid.
- Field: `field.wave`, `field.tilt`, and `field.detail` warp the plate.
- Field motion: `motion.amount` scales the timeline-driven loop. Transport stays on the top timeline.
- Ink: `appearance.inks` is a growable swatch list. Paper stays `appearance.background`.
- Journal Post: `journal.entryId`, `journal.assignKind`, and `journal.alt` select destination, delivery kind, and accessibility text.
- Background: `export.includeBackground` and `appearance.background` use the required export row.
- Image Export: `export.image.format` and `export.image.resolution` use the required export pair.
- Video Export: `export.video.format` and `export.video.resolution` use the required video pair.

### Renderer Technique Decision Matrix

- Source representation: uploaded raster image decoded once and cached by media identity.
- Product representation: raster text illustration.
- Preview renderer: Canvas 2D, because the product is a bounded glyph grid rather than a per-source-pixel filter.
- Export renderer: Canvas 2D through `createToolcraftPngExportCanvas`.
- Workload: up to 220 columns over a 16:9 output; source decode and luminance sampling are cached separately from glyph/color composition.
- Alternatives rejected: DOM creates thousands of layout nodes; SVG bloats export markup; WebGL would require a glyph atlas and adds complexity without a measured need at this bounded grid size.

### Render Pipeline Inventory

- `source-decode`: decode and cache the selected image; invalidated only by media import/clear.
- `source-sample`: cover-crop and sample luminance into the selected column grid; invalidated by source, canvas ratio, columns, contrast, or invert.
- `glyph-layout`: map sampled values through the active/custom character ramp; invalidated by samples, preset, or custom ramp.
- `plate-composite`: paint background, glyphs, and Cipher-like marks; invalidated by glyph layout, ink, background, Include, marks, or field.
- `loop-present`: cheap timeline present of the current plate; invalidated by playback time and motion amount, not by a full rasterize.
- `png-export`: rerun the same pipeline at the selected 2K/4K/8K output size.
- `video-export`: encode timeline-stamped frames at Current or 4K.

## Decisions

### Renderer

- Decision: Use a Canvas 2D glyph plate that cover-crops the source, samples luminance into a bounded column grid, and paints Geist Mono marks in journal ink on the site ground.
- Reason: The product is a still illustration for a 16:9 journal frame, not a per-pixel filter or a 3D scene, so Canvas 2D keeps preview and PNG export on one pipeline.
- Evidence: `src/app/renderer/ascii-renderer.ts`, `src/app/renderer/ascii-canvas.tsx`, `src/app/ascii-studio.css` loading the site Geist Mono file, and typed Canvas 2D coverage in `src/app/app-performance.ts`.

### Timeline

- Decision: Enable the top Toolcraft playback timeline with a 3s default loop.
- Reason: Cipher’s Animate defaults are 36 frames at 12 fps, and Export Video requires timeline transport. The loop is seamless and forward-only.
- Evidence: `panels.timeline.mode` is `playback`, `defaultDurationSeconds` is 3, and `appTransferMode.animationIntent` is `timeline-playback` with reference loop provenance.

### Layers

- Decision: Omit the Layers panel.
- Reason: The app edits one source image and one composited plate, with no reorder, visibility, or multi-entity layer workflow.
- Evidence: `appSchema.panels.layers` is omitted and source replacement is handled by the built-in `fileDrop` control.

### Controls

- Decision: Use Toolcraft built-ins for image drop, Paper inbox select/actions, columns, character-set presets plus a custom ramp, contrast, invert, ink, ground, journal destination, and required Background/Image Export rows.
- Reason: fileDrop, select, slider, switch, text, color, actions, and panelActions cover the authoring stages without a custom control.
- Evidence: `src/app/app-schema.ts`, `starterControlSectionInventory`, and product acceptance in `src/app/acceptance/defaults.ts`.

### Export

- Decision: Keep PNG/JPG delivery, add Export Video at Current/4K, and let Assign write a live plate (default), looping video, or still.
- Reason: The journal should play the plate live; video is the portable loop; still remains available.
- Evidence: `export-video.ts`, `panel-actions.ts`, and the Vite `journal-authoring` assign kinds.

### Performance

- Decision: Cache source decode by media identity, sample luminance into the selected column grid, and paint glyphs at the preview backing size; measure the heaviest useful 220-column / 4K paths.
- Reason: The product workload is a bounded glyph grid rather than a per-source-pixel shader, so decode and sampling can stay separate from ink/ground recomposition.
- Evidence: `src/app/app-performance.ts` Canvas 2D pixel-output scenarios and the existing agent-browser performance checkpoint recorded in this worklog.

## Decision Trail

### Iteration 22 — Inks, mark toggles, and source framing

- Request: Add and remove as many plate inks as wanted, turn Cipher-like marks on or off by kind, and grab/drag the source framing.
- Task type: Shared kernel, schema/controls, canvas handle, acceptance, and targeted verification.
- User-visible result: Ink is a growable swatch collection; seven mark switches filter the shape bank; Frame zoom/offset plus a center pin reframe the sampled source. Journal lock stays paper `#fafafa`, one ink `#111111`, all marks on.
- Source/reference checked: Cipher mark/color/frame behavior as inspiration only. Not a dither/grain/no-source clone.
- Reference inputs: Prior Cipher study and the attached palette/framing plan. No Figma or video file.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, `core/control-selection.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `performance.md`, and canvas-handle rules.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Keep paper as Background. Model extra colors as `collectionActions` inks remapped across remaining tones. Restrict `pickMarkKind` to the enabled bank, with an empty bank falling back to tick. Bake frame zoom/offset into `drawCover` so the crop is in the packed tones. Official handle is a small center pin; dragging the plate also writes `frame.offset`.
- Alternatives rejected: Built-in `palette`; section titles Palette/Colors; cloning Cipher dither/grain/no-source; a full-plate handle; journal crop UI.
- State/output mapping: `appearance.inks` and `marks.{kind}` feed `paintPlate`; `frame.zoom`/`frame.offset` merge into sample-time cover-crop; the pin writes `frame.offset`.
- Files changed: `src/lib/ascii-plate/*`, studio schema/renderer/canvas handle, acceptance/performance, README, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run verify:quick` plus targeted studio/journal browser checks.
- Skipped checks: Full verify:perf is not required for this post-first-working feature loop; new responsiveness names are declared.
- Risks: Zoom 1 on a matching aspect has no pan slack. The last enabled mark cannot disappear from the plate because an empty bank paints ticks.

### Iteration 21 — Cipher marks, live plates, and video loops

- Request: Mix Cipher-like shapes into the ASCII characters and ship looping video plus interactive journal items.
- Task type: Shared renderer kernel, schema/controls, playback timeline, video export, journal media type, acceptance, and targeted verification.
- User-visible result: Studio mixes ticks, slashes, wedges, rings, and smears into the glyph plate; a 3s timeline loops the field; Assign defaults to a live journal plate and can also write video or a still.
- Source/reference checked: Live [Cipher](https://www.playgrnd.tools/cipher) controls (Grid, Field, Marks, Animate, Export PNG/Video). Not a runtime clone.
- Reference inputs: Cipher as mark/motion inspiration. No Figma or video file.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, `core/timeline-animation.md`, `core/setup-export.md`, `renderer-technique.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, and `performance.md`.
- Contract rules applied: `timeline-mode-choice`, `timeline-enabled-behavior`, `output-export-required`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Extract a Toolcraft-free plate kernel at `src/lib/ascii-plate`, bake the tone field into `plate.json`, keep one ink on paper, and use playback timeline rather than autonomous wall-clock motion in the studio.
- Alternatives rejected: Cloning Cipher’s multi-ink/dither/grain tool; video-only journal delivery; putting the studio on a public Next route.
- State/output mapping: `marks.*`, `field.*`, and `motion.amount` feed `paintPlate`; timeline progress comes from `getToolcraftTimelineLoopProgress`; Assign writes PNG + recipe, video, or PNG.
- Files changed: `src/lib/ascii-plate/*`, journal `entries.ts`/`entry-media.tsx`/`entry-plate.tsx`, studio schema/renderer/export/assign, acceptance/performance, README/PRODUCT, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run verify:quick` plus targeted studio/journal browser checks.
- Skipped checks: Full verify:perf is not required for this post-first-working feature loop; animation and video scenarios are declared.
- Risks: Browser MP4 MediaRecorder support varies; WebM is the fallback. Plate recipes are versioned and must stay parseable.

### Iteration 20 — Journal-column default plate

- Request: Make the default studio size as wide as the journal column and about half as tall as it is wide.
- Task type: Schema defaults, assign export size, journal media frame, and targeted verification.
- User-visible result: Fresh studio canvas is 672×336 (2:1). Journal media frames use the same ratio. Assign writes a 2K PNG of the current plate.
- Source/reference checked: Site column `max-width: 42rem` in `src/app/globals.css` and `src/components/entry-media.tsx`.
- Reference inputs: None.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md` and `core/setup-export.md`.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `output-export-required`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Use 672×336 as the explicit product canvas default, the journal column at a 16px root, with height at half width. Keep Setup size editors available.
- Alternatives rejected: Keeping 16:9 because assigned plates would be cropped in a 2:1 frame; using 600px because the live column is 42rem / 672px.
- State/output mapping: `app-schema.ts` canvas.size seeds Setup width/height; assign reads the live canvas and exports at 2K; `EntryMediaFigure` uses `aspect-[2/1]`.
- Files changed: `journal-plate.ts`, `app-schema.ts`, `panel-actions.ts`, `entry-media.tsx`, README, schema/e2e expectations, and this worklog.
- Verification: pnpm verify:quick targeted schema test; controlled-browser check of Setup 672×336 and the journal media frame.
- Skipped checks: None. Timeline, layers, and video remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Risks: The one existing journal still now sits in a 2:1 frame instead of 16:9.

### Iteration 19 — ASCII Journal Studio

- Request: Make a local Toolcraft workspace that accepts a dropped image or Paper export, iterates an ink-on-paper ASCII illustration, and assigns the plate to an existing journal post.
- Task type: Schema, Canvas 2D renderer, media import, local journal assignment API, acceptance, performance, and browser verification.
- User-visible result: `pnpm studio` opens a 16:9 Geist Mono plate with source, illustration, ink, journal, background, and export controls; Assign writes `public/media/<id>.png` and only the entry `media` field.
- Source/reference checked: The site journal media contract in `PRODUCT.md`, `src/lib/entries.ts`, `src/components/entry-media.tsx`, Toolcraft ASCII example, and [toolcraft.sh](https://toolcraft.sh/).
- Reference inputs: None. No Figma, video, GIF, or still was supplied as a visual reference.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core runtime/setup/control/layout/media/performance modules, `assembly-workflow.md`, `schema-reference.md`, `component-rules.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `renderer-technique.md`, and `performance.md`.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `canvas-surface-preserved`, `layers-enable-only-when-needed`, `timeline-mode-choice`, `controls-product-coverage`, `output-export-required`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Keep the public Next journal read-only; run Toolcraft as `studio/ascii`; load Geist Mono from the site package; confine inbox/assign writes to `studio/inbox`, `content/entries`, and `public/media`.
- Alternatives rejected: A Next route because the studio is not a public capability; embedding Paper because `paperRef` must stay agents-only; CRT/scanline styling because DESIGN.md forbids it; creating entries from the studio because curated copy stays a separate edit.
- State/output mapping: `source.image` and inbox load feed `ascii-renderer.ts`; illustration/appearance targets paint the plate; `journal.entryId` and `journal.alt` go to `/api/journal/assign`; Export PNG uses the selected format and resolution.
- Files changed: `studio/ascii` product schema, renderer, panel actions, Vite authoring middleware, acceptance/performance matrices, README/PRODUCT notes, and this worklog.
- Verification: pnpm verify:quick; agent-browser performance checkpoint.
- Skipped checks: None. Timeline, layers, and video remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Risks: Assign is available only on the Vite development server. Paper files must be exported into `studio/inbox` before Load selected.

### Iteration 1 — Morflax Effects reference port

- Request: Copy the Effects behavior from the Morflax Abstract Torus creator, allow a custom 3D model, keep the existing Toolcraft shell behavior, and omit the timeline.
- Task type: Reference-runtime study, product schema, WebGL renderer, media import, export, acceptance, performance, and browser verification.
- User-visible result: A lit Torus or uploaded 3D model supports Pixelate, Dither, ASCII, Halftone, Mosaic, Bricks, Pointillism, Heatmap, Threshold, Duotone, color adjustments, and six post effects in the Toolcraft editor.
- Source/reference checked: Live `https://studio.morflax.com/abstract/create/Torus` route, its Effects DOM, dropdown options, conditional controls, slider ranges/defaults, preset colors, WebGL output, and this app in the controlled browser.
- Reference inputs: Runnable Morflax Studio Abstract Torus Effects route; no Figma, image, GIF, or video reference was supplied.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core runtime/setup/control/layout/media/timeline/performance/reference modules, `assembly-workflow.md`, `schema-reference.md`, `component-rules.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `renderer-technique.md`, and `performance.md`.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `canvas-surface-preserved`, `layers-enable-only-when-needed`, `timeline-mode-choice`, `controls-product-coverage`, `output-export-required`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Port the observed Effects contract into schema-backed Toolcraft controls and one Three.js WebGL renderer, with Toolcraft-native model upload, canvas, toolbar, Background, Image Export, and sticky output action.
- Alternatives rejected: Screenshot imitation because it cannot reproduce behavior; DOM/SVG because they cannot preserve mesh depth; Canvas 2D because dense effects would move live pixel work to the CPU; WebGPU because it adds compatibility risk without a product benefit; timeline/video because the user explicitly excluded transport.
- State/output mapping: Runtime targets in `app-schema.ts` are parsed by `effect-state.ts`, applied as scene/shader uniforms by `three-effects-engine.ts`, and reused by the still-image export path; `source.model` maps to GLTFLoader/OBJLoader with procedural Torus fallback.
- Files changed: `src/app` schema, presets, renderer, panel actions, acceptance and performance configs/tests; `src/routes/index.tsx`; product e2e tests; package dependencies; product plan; title marker; and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` passed; targeted Vitest acceptance/performance contracts passed; five product Playwright scenarios passed individually; reference and product screenshots were inspected; agent-browser performance checkpoint passed.
- Skipped checks: None.
- Risks: External `.gltf` files that depend on sidecar buffers/textures cannot be reconstructed from a single-file upload; users should prefer GLB or embedded glTF. Future Morflax deployments can change after this source-verified snapshot.

### Iteration 2 — Source-level effect parity and middle-button rotation

- Request: Correct the approximate effect application, especially ASCII, study the source more deeply, make behavior identical to the reference, and rotate the model while the middle mouse button is held.
- Task type: Source-level reference audit, broad WebGL pass replacement, schema correction, direct manipulation, acceptance, performance, and browser verification.
- User-visible result: ASCII now uses the recovered analytic masks and generated glyph atlas; every stylized mode uses its recovered fragment shader and exact uniform mapping; post passes run in reference order; Dither exposes its missing conditional values; middle-drag rotates the model and the same rotation is used by preview/export.
- Source/reference checked: Live `https://studio.morflax.com/abstract/create/Torus`, `/_nuxt/0c43fd8.js` for UI/state/default mappings, and `/_nuxt/c4d3150.js` for shader definitions, `EffectsManager`, `generateCharTexture`, resize scaling, Bloom factory, and pass order.
- Reference inputs: Runnable Morflax route and its browser-delivered Nuxt JavaScript bundles; no Figma, image, GIF, or video reference was supplied.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, reference study, runtime boundary, assembly workflow, decision contract, acceptance, performance, and renderer technique docs; required brainstorming, writing-plans, systematic-debugging, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Replace the monolithic approximate shader with an EffectComposer graph: scene → one active stylized pass → Bloom → Depth of Field → Chromatic → pre-grain cache → Film Grain → Gradient Overlay → Vignette → adjustments → output. Preserve the no-effect direct render path when all correction values are neutral and reuse the pre-grain cache for autonomous frames without changing pixels or pass order.
- ASCII decision: Generate 64px-per-glyph, bold 54px monospace nearest-filtered atlases; use the exact Hash/Matrix/Binary/Braille/Morse/Dots/Slashes sets, deterministic per-cell glyph selection, continuous-coordinate anti-aliasing, spacing gap colors, and Classic polarity.
- Rotation decision: A visible `model.rotation` vector is the runtime source of truth. Middle-pointer drag uses pointer capture, maps horizontal movement to yaw and vertical movement to pitch, merges history, coalesces state commits through requestAnimationFrame, leaves left-button canvas pan intact, and resets through the normal Model section action.
- Alternatives rejected: Retuning the old analytic approximation because it could not express atlas-backed characters or exact matrices; isolated local rotation state because it would diverge from export/reset/settings transfer; hijacking left drag because Toolcraft owns viewport pan.
- State/output mapping: `effect-state.ts` maps reference values to exact numeric uniforms; `three-effects-engine.ts` enables the matching pass and generated atlas; `model.rotation` transforms the loaded root group before the scene pass; export constructs the same settings and composer graph.
- Files changed: schema, effect-state parser/tests, source shader table, Three effects engine, Morflax Bloom pass, canvas interaction, acceptance/reference inventory, performance inventory/tests, browser tests, parity plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check`, typecheck, build, source-mapping Vitest tests, focused ASCII/middle-button Playwright acceptance, middle-button performance budget, all ten stylized WebGL branches, all six post branches, and `gl.getError() === 0` passed before the final gate.
- Skipped checks: Full performance checkpoint is not required for this post-first-working non-performance correction; the touched rotation/viewport path has a targeted browser budget check. Layers/timeline/video remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Completion: `npm run verify:final` and the final saved-URL agent-browser smoke test both passed.
- Risks: The live service can deploy new effect code after this snapshot. GLB and embedded glTF remain the reliable single-file uploads; external glTF sidecars are outside the fileDrop contract.

### Iteration 3 — Effect application and Resolution fidelity audit

- Request: Recheck that the effects are copied one-to-one and diagnose why Resolution ×2 remains blurry.
- Task type: Source/bundle re-audit, Three.js runtime alignment, renderer sizing correction, exact uniform-transform correction, schema cleanup, WebGL acceptance, and targeted performance verification.
- User-visible result: Resolution ×2 now renders a genuinely larger physical buffer; ASCII cells keep the same reference-logical size while gaining detail; Chromatic, Film Grain, Tilt Shift, focus-pad Y, Bloom blend/normalization, and Gradient Overlay map to the current Morflax source behavior.
- Source/reference checked: Live `https://studio.morflax.com/abstract/create/Torus`, current `/_nuxt/0c43fd8.js` UI/state bundle, current `/_nuxt/c4d3150.js` Three/effects bundle, and local browser output at Resolution ×1/×2.
- Reference inputs: Current runnable Morflax Torus route and browser-delivered source bundles; no Figma, image, GIF, or video reference was supplied.
- Docs/contracts read: Required Toolcraft workflow, reference-study, runtime-boundary, setup/export, media-upload, performance, assembly, acceptance, decision, schema, component, and renderer-technique docs; required systematic-debugging, brainstorming, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-no-app-ui`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Use Three.js r164.1 like the shipped reference; preserve its HalfFloat/MSAA composer, pass order, Bloom pipeline, shader sources, logical resize scaling, and generated ASCII atlas. Preview physical pixels are fitted CSS size × DPR × Resolution scale, while shader `resolution` and size uniforms stay at the logical fitted size.
- ASCII decision: Keep source `asciiType = 0`; map analytic shapes 0–6 and atlas shapes to 7; generate the exact 64px/glyph, bold 54px monospace, nearest-filtered atlas with the exact shipped character strings; apply `cellSize`, brightness, spacing, invert, and colorMode without physical-resolution multiplication.
- Post-effect mapping: Convert Tilt Shift degrees to radians; invert focus-pad Y; map Chromatic display Amount as `value × 0.1`; map Film Grain display Grain as `0.3 × value²`; default Bloom to Add; retain source r164 strength normalization; and expose only Gradient Overlay Start, End, Angle, Opacity, preset, and swap values that feed the shipped linear shader.
- Alternatives rejected: Retaining the 720px/DPR caps because they caused the reported blur; multiplying ASCII size by output pixels because it changed the effect scale; using Three r185 with compensation constants because its Bloom implementation differs; keeping the compound gradient control because its type/stop position/stop opacity values do not exist in the Morflax shader.
- State/output mapping: Schema values are transformed in `effect-state.ts`, applied to source shader uniforms in `three-effects-engine.ts`, and reused by export. `canvas.renderScale` changes only physical preview sampling; export still renders the same pipeline at the selected image dimensions.
- Files changed: Three dependencies/lockfile, app schema, effect-state parser/tests, effects canvas, Three engine, Bloom pass, panel actions, acceptance/performance browser tests and helpers, performance inventory, parity plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run verify:quick` passed with 50 files and 251 tests; focused source-mapping tests passed; both Effects browser acceptance scenarios passed; all ten stylized and six post branches, Hash ASCII, exact Gradient Overlay controls, middle-button rotation/reset, WebGL error state, and full backing pixels passed; the targeted worst-case WebGL preview scenario passed.
- Skipped checks: The full performance checkpoint is not required for this post-first-working fidelity correction. The touched full-resolution preview workload ran its targeted worst-case scenario; layers, timeline, video, and persistence reload remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Completion: `npm run verify:final` passed with 251 Vitest tests, a production build, and all 21 non-performance Playwright browser tests.
- Risks: Resolution ×2 on a DPR 2 display intentionally renders four physical pixels per CSS axis (`5120×2880` for the fitted 1280×720 preview), so low-end/software WebGL may update heavy multi-pass effects more slowly. Static quality and export dimensions are not reduced.

### Iteration 4 — Full-resolution effects performance optimization

- Request: Diagnose why the local app lags while the reference stays responsive, then optimize it without undoing the source-matched effects or the sharp Resolution ×2 output.
- Task type: Tier 4 renderer/canvas optimization, reference comparison, GPU pass/invalidation audit, targeted fallback diagnostics, agent-browser performance checkpoint, and final regression verification.
- User-visible result: Dynamic Film Grain holds 60 fps at the real 4800×2700 backing buffer; representative Chromatic, Blur, Bloom, and ASCII interactions stay responsive; toolbar zoom no longer forces an unchanged WebGL render; Resolution ×2, all effect controls, export quality, and middle-button rotation remain intact.
- Source/reference checked: Current live `https://studio.morflax.com/abstract/create/Torus`, current local `http://127.0.0.1:3003/`, Three.js r164.1 `EffectComposer`, `OutputPass`, and `UnrealBloomPass` sources, Toolcraft performance contracts, and the existing app performance matrix.
- Reference inputs: Current runnable Morflax Torus route and its browser-delivered Effects runtime; current local full-resolution app; no Figma, image, GIF, or video reference was supplied for this optimization pass.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, `decision-contract.md`, core performance/reference/runtime modules, `performance.md`, `renderer-technique.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Baseline: In the DPR 2 agent browser, local Resolution ×2 processed 5120×2880 (14.75 MP) while the reference processed 1880×1288 (2.42 MP), about 6.1× fewer pixels. In the same fallback browser profile, local animated Grain measured about 10.2 fps / 133 ms maximum frame gap while the reference with Grain enabled measured about 120.6 fps / 9.3 ms. The local chain also ran neutral Adjustments, standalone Output, an input copy, a repeated scene raster, and an overwritten parent Bloom additive composite.
- Contract rules applied: `renderer-technique-inventory`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `canvas-surface-preserved`, `controls-product-coverage`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Cache the full-size, HalfFloat, 4× MSAA scene only across post-effect uniform changes; feed it directly into a two-target HalfFloat post composer whose full-screen targets do not use ineffective MSAA; fuse Three's tone-map/sRGB output transform into the terminal Morflax ShaderPass; disable neutral Adjustments; remove the animated input copy; run the exact reference Bloom high-pass/mip/composite sequence without `super.render()`'s overwritten additive blend; and suppress no-op ResizeObserver renders.
- Quality preservation: Physical canvas pixels, DPR × selected render scale, logical shader sizing, source shader table, effect order, effect sample counts (including 64-tap Blur), tone mapping, scene MSAA, HalfFloat precision, export dimensions, and live control updates are unchanged. Bloom internal targets now remain at the physical composer size rather than being overwritten with logical dimensions.
- Alternatives rejected: Lowering render scale, capping DPR, downsampling/upscaling post effects, reducing Blur samples, debouncing until pointer release, weakening animation frequency, or relaxing budgets because each would change visible quality or interaction semantics. Replacing the source shaders with cheaper approximations was rejected because the user requires reference behavior.
- State/output mapping: Scene cache invalidation is limited to model identity/rotation, background, canvas size, and render scale. Effect, adjustment, and post controls update stable uniforms and rerun only the required source-ordered post graph. Dynamic Grain reads the cached pre-grain texture directly and presents through its terminal shader.
- Files changed: `three-effects-engine.ts`, new `external-texture-composer.ts`, `morflax-bloom-pass.ts`, `effects-canvas.tsx`, renderer tests, `app-performance.ts`, the Tier 4 optimization plan, and this worklog.
- Fallback diagnostic improvement: ASCII maximum frame gap improved 391.6→108.4 ms; Bloom Radius interaction 10824.3→2734.4 ms; Blur Angle 7124.9→3933.3 ms; Chromatic Amount 4484.2→1078 ms; Grain Amount 9279.4→2791.3 ms. Animated Grain passed its fallback frame budget. The remaining software-renderer misses are retained as evidence rather than hidden by lower quality or changed budgets.
- Agent-browser performance checkpoint: Passed at 4800×2700 backing pixels. Grain=1 measured 60.15 fps with a 17.7 ms maximum frame gap; Chromatic drag 431 ms / 33.4 ms; Blur Angle drag 531 ms / 68.3 ms; full-resolution Bloom Radius drag 458 ms / 17.2 ms; Matrix ASCII selection 123 ms / 50 ms; combined Bloom + Grain toolbar zoom 148 ms / 17.6 ms; post-check WebGL error was 0.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check` passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed with 50 files and 253 tests; focused source-matched effects/middle-button and autonomous-Grain browser acceptance passed; real backing pixels and visual output were inspected in the controlled browser.
- Completion: `npm run verify:final` passed with 253 Vitest tests, a production build, and all 21 non-performance Playwright browser tests after the agent-browser performance checkpoint passed.
- Skipped checks: None. The full performance checkpoint used the contract-preferred agent-controlled hardware browser; six targeted Playwright software-renderer diagnostics were also retained for before/after evidence.
- Risks: The app intentionally renders roughly six times the reference's live pixel count in the measured layouts when local Resolution ×2 is selected. Hardware WebGL meets the agent-browser checkpoint; software-only WebGL can still exceed the declared interaction budgets for multi-tap Blur and repeated synthetic slider steps. No preview or export quality was reduced to mask that ceiling.

### Iteration 5 — Physical base-scene and volumetric effect parity

- Request: Investigate why the reference preserves a more complex sense of volume under effects than the local implementation, using the supplied `CleanShot 2026-07-10 at 15.38.07@2x.png` as visual evidence, and find the incorrectly copied parts.
- Task type: Tier 4 source/runtime scene audit, dependency addition, Three.js geometry/material/environment/camera/light correction, reference comparison, acceptance/performance evidence, and final regression verification.
- User-visible result: Dither, ASCII, and every other screen-space effect now receive the reference Torus's nested studio reflections, inner-wall shading, opposing highlights, and intermediate luminance bands instead of quantizing the old flat three-light render.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied 870×1080 reference still image; current live `https://studio.morflax.com/abstract/create/Torus`; live Three.js scene, camera, material, texture, light, and geometry state; `/_nuxt/c4d3150.js`; `/_nuxt/0c43fd8.js`; and local before/after Dither output in the controlled browser.
- Reference inputs: User-supplied 870×1080 still image showing a peach/teal Dither Torus with layered volume; runnable Morflax Torus route and its browser-delivered source/runtime; current local app.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, reference study, runtime boundary, assembly workflow, schema reference, decision contract, renderer technique, acceptance, core/app performance docs, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Baseline/root cause: The local Torus used `TorusGeometry(1.1, 0.38, 96, 192)`, a nearly non-metallic `MeshStandardMaterial` (`metalness: 0.08`), a 34-degree camera, hemisphere/key/blue-rim lighting, no environment, and a baked base rotation. The original uses the environment to create the multiple luminance layers that the already source-matched Dither/ASCII shaders preserve.
- Contract rules applied: `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `canvas-surface-preserved`, `controls-product-coverage`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Port the inspected base scene exactly: source Torus constructor `TorusGeometry(1.5, 0.48, 34, 62)`, normalization to outer radius `1.58`, mesh scale `1.1`, zero base rotation, white `MeshPhysicalMaterial` with metalness `1`/roughness `0.6`, the `Studio_HDRI_43.jpg` equirectangular environment at intensity `1.25`, one white directional light at `(-4, 10, 6)` with intensity `0.4π`, and the inspected 15-degree camera/clip range/position.
- Environment finding: Morflax sends `Studio_HDRI_43.jpg` through `HDRJPGLoader`, but the current file has no embedded gain-map metadata. The original emits the same warning and uses the loader's SDR-to-linear-HalfFloat fallback. The local renderer deliberately mirrors that behavior instead of incorrectly claiming or approximating a hidden HDR gain map.
- Alternatives rejected: Retuning Dither thresholds because the shader was quantizing the wrong scene input; adding more local lights because it cannot reproduce image-based studio reflections; baking highlights into the procedural Torus because uploads must receive the same environment; using an ordinary sRGB `TextureLoader` because it would not mirror the reference linear HalfFloat loader path; lowering preview resolution or removing scene MSAA because both would undo the sharpness/performance quality decisions from the prior pass and the reference Effects composer itself uses a 4-sample target.
- State/output mapping: `morflax-scene-profile.ts` is the immutable source profile; `model-loader.ts` creates the exact physical fallback and normalizes uploads to the same footprint; `three-effects-engine.ts` awaits the studio environment and rasterizes the scene once into the existing MSAA cache; every existing stylized/post pass and PNG export consumes that corrected cache.
- Files changed: package dependency/lockfile; scene profile and tests; model loader; Three effects engine/tests; acceptance/reference inventory; performance pipeline inventory; the volume-parity plan; and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check`, typecheck, focused 34-test source/acceptance/performance group, and `npm run verify:quick` passed with 51 files and 256 Vitest tests. Focused browser acceptance for all effect branches/middle rotation and OBJ upload/clear passed (2 tests). Controlled-browser comparison at the real 4800×2700 backing buffer matched the reference's opposing highlights and inner-wall bands; warmed middle-drag measured 352.8 ms with an 83.3 ms maximum frame gap and `gl.getError() === 0` behavior remains covered. `npm run verify:final` then passed all 256 Vitest tests, production build, and 21 non-performance Playwright browser tests.
- Performance evidence: The required post-first-working full checkpoint is not triggered by this non-performance parity pass. Three optional Playwright software-WebGL diagnostics exceeded their strict budgets, consistent with the previously recorded fallback ceiling; no thresholds or quality were reduced. On Apple M4 Pro/Metal at 4800×2700, the touched warmed rotation path stayed inside its declared 650 ms interaction/90 ms frame-gap budget. Dither size changed at full quality in 102.8 ms with an 83.3 ms maximum gap, a diagnostic 3.3 ms above its 80 ms post-only target; this path was not made more expensive by the cached scene correction.
- Skipped checks: No new full performance checkpoint because this is a post-first-working non-performance parity correction; the touched hardware rotation workload and optional post-only/fallback diagnostics were run instead. Timeline, layers, video, and persistence reload remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Completion: Final gate passed and the saved local app at `http://127.0.0.1:3003/` served the correct `3D Effects Studio` identity with the corrected Torus scene.
- Risks: The environment is loaded from the same cross-origin Morflax static URL as the reference; a future asset removal or reference deployment can change this exact scene independently. GLB and embedded glTF remain the reliable single-file upload formats.

### Iteration 6 — Six-axis orientation gizmo and camera-orbit parity

- Request: Replace the panel rotation pad with the supplied reference orientation element, match its design and mechanics one-to-one at the lower-left of the screen, remove reference-brand naming from implementation code, and rotate the object with held left mouse instead of middle mouse.
- Task type: Tier 4 source/runtime interaction audit, custom Toolcraft control, renderer camera-state migration, viewport gesture arbitration, acceptance/performance coverage, neutral implementation naming, and browser verification.
- User-visible result: The viewport now has a 70px circular six-axis orientation gizmo 16px from its lower-left edge. Axis hover, 600ms click snap, constrained axis drag, and plain left-drag over the 3D output all update the camera; middle drag no longer rotates. The handle stays fixed during Toolcraft zoom and remains outside PNG output.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied 270×260 PNG still; the live orientation canvas, camera, and controller state; the browser-delivered UI/controller bundles; and the local app in the controlled browser.
- Reference inputs: User-supplied 270×260 @2x still showing the dark circular X/Y/Z orientation element; runnable reference route and its browser-delivered source/runtime; current local app.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core reference/runtime/control/layout/performance modules, assembly, schema, decision, custom-control, component, acceptance, renderer-technique, and performance docs; required brainstorming, writing-plans, systematic-debugging, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Baseline/root cause: The previous `model.rotation` vector and middle-drag changed the model root's Euler angles. The reference leaves the model transform intact and orbits the perspective camera, so HDRI reflections, lighting, camera up, axis projection, and snap behavior necessarily diverged even when the final screen angle looked similar.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Camera decision: Use one schema-backed `view.orbit` pose containing absolute camera position and up vectors. Preview, PNG export, left-drag, gizmo snap/drag, reset, undo/redo, and settings transfer all read or write the same value. The engine applies that pose to the camera before scene rasterization and no longer rotates the model.
- Gizmo decision: Render one viewport portal Canvas2D surface at 70×70 CSS / 140×140 backing pixels, center 35, reach 24.5, dot radius 5.6, hover radius 7.28, line width 2.1, black 0.8 background, X `#ff215e`, Y `#53ff55`, Z `#3b69ff`, front/rear alpha 0.95/0.3, and rear-to-front depth ordering. Snap preserves radius, uses the six inspected position/up targets, and applies quadratic ease-in-out over 600ms.
- Interaction decision: Plain left drag on the product WebGL canvas uses the inspected OrbitControls spherical mapping at rotate speed 0.5 and stops Toolcraft pan. Modifier-left remains available for Toolcraft viewport pan; left drag outside the product surface still belongs to the shell. Middle drag is inert for camera orientation. Gizmo axis drag applies the inspected ±X/±Y/±Z rotation axes and signs to both camera position and up.
- Custom-control decision: The built-in `vector` was checked and rejected because it cannot represent the screen-projected six-axis camera pose or canvas hit targets. `orientationGizmo` owns runtime state/reset semantics while a separate canvas-handle acceptance row proves drag, output change, visual-language bounds, fixed placement, and export exclusion.
- Neutral naming decision: Renderer files, classes, shader exports, scene-profile symbols, texture labels, settings-transfer identifiers, tests, and user-facing test names use product-neutral names. The only remaining reference-brand strings under `src` are the immutable live reference and external HDRI URLs required as evidence/resources.
- Alternatives rejected: Restyling the old vector pad because its two-number value model cannot express camera up or six-axis projection; continuing mesh rotation because it changes environment response; keeping middle drag because it contradicts the inspected controller; placing the handle in canvas-world coordinates because it would scale/pan; local component-only state because reset/export/settings would diverge; patching copied Toolcraft runtime because supported schema/controlRenderer/canvas-handle extension points are sufficient.
- State/output mapping: `app-schema.ts` declares `view.orbit`; `orbit-camera.ts` owns safe pose parsing and exact free/snap/constrained math; `orientation-gizmo-control.tsx` owns the Canvas2D handle; `effects-canvas.tsx` owns plain-left orbit and history coalescing; `effect-state.ts` maps the pose; `three-effects-engine.ts` applies it to the camera and scene-cache key; PNG export reuses the same settings.
- Files changed: schema, effect state/tests, orbit math/tests, orientation-gizmo custom renderer, effects canvas, Three engine, scene/model/bloom/shader neutral names, route registration, acceptance/reference inventory, renderer pipeline/performance scenario, browser helpers/tests, implementation plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 264 Vitest tests. Controlled-browser checks confirmed 70×70 CSS / 140×140 backing, exact 16px lower-left insets, left-drag camera change with stable canvas origin, +Y snap position/up, constrained drag position/up, fixed insets after zoom, and no console errors. Focused source/effects/orbit/export/WebGL Playwright acceptance passed. The warmed `browser perf: view.orbit remains responsive` scenario passed its unchanged 90ms frame-gap, 650ms interaction, and 180ms long-task budgets.
- Completion: `npm run verify:final` passed with all 264 Vitest tests, production build, and all 21 non-performance Playwright browser tests.
- Skipped checks: The full browser performance checkpoint is not required for this post-first-working non-performance feature pass. The touched full-resolution camera-orbit path ran its targeted browser performance scenario; timeline, layers, video, and persistence reload remain inapplicable.
- Risks: The 600ms snap intentionally emits camera-pose history updates throughout the animation. Very low-end software WebGL can still render full-resolution scene invalidations more slowly than hardware WebGL; initialization/decode is measured separately from the warmed live-drag budget.

### Iteration 7 — Blender-style free orientation-point drag

- Request: Keep the existing orientation element but make grabbing any visible point behave like Blender so the user can freely rotate the view in the desired direction.
- Task type: Tier 3 custom canvas-handle interaction change, camera-math cleanup, acceptance/performance remapping, and real-browser verification.
- User-visible result: Pressing an axis point no longer snaps immediately. A short click still animates the existing 600ms axis snap, while moving more than 3 CSS pixels turns the same gesture into a free two-axis orbit from the current camera pose with no initial jump and no snap after release.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied PNG still, Blender Viewport Preferences Interactive Navigation documentation, the current gizmo implementation, the existing main-canvas orbit math, and the running local app.
- Reference inputs: User-supplied still image of the circular six-axis widget and official Blender interaction documentation; no Figma, GIF, or video reference was supplied.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core reference/runtime/control/layout/performance modules, custom-control, component, acceptance, renderer-technique, performance docs, and required brainstorming, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Preserve the visual design, lower-left placement, depth sorting, hit targets, and click snap. Delay click semantics until pointer up, use a 3px cumulative drag threshold, then feed both pointer deltas into the same viewport-height-scaled spherical orbit used by the main canvas. One runtime `view.orbit` value and one merged history group remain the source of truth.
- Intentional reference change: The previous inspected widget's axis-constrained drag is now marked `intentionally-changed` because the user explicitly requested Blender-style free point dragging. Blender's documented Interactive Navigation click/drag split is the new behavior source for this gesture.
- Alternatives rejected: Snapping on pointer down because it causes a visible starting jump; keeping axis-specific signs because it prevents free diagonal orbit; scaling by the 70px widget height because it makes the camera excessively sensitive; rotating the model root because preview, reflections, export, and the orientation display would diverge.
- State/output mapping: `orientation-gizmo-control.tsx` distinguishes pending click from free drag; `orbit-camera.ts` provides the shared free-orbit and snap math; schema, acceptance, renderer invalidation, preview, export, reset, and undo/redo continue to use `view.orbit` without state-shape changes.
- Files changed: orientation-gizmo interaction, orbit math/tests, schema help, acceptance/reference inventory, targeted performance scenario, browser acceptance/performance tests, implementation plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check` and `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 264 Vitest tests. Focused browser acceptance passed. The targeted `browser perf: view.orbit remains responsive` scenario passed the existing 90ms frame-gap, 650ms interaction, and 180ms long-task budgets. Controlled-browser verification measured the 70×70 handle, confirmed exact +X click snap, changed both off-axis camera components during an 18px diagonal drag, and confirmed the free pose remained unchanged 700ms after release.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full browser performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working, non-performance Tier 3 interaction pass. Export, media, dependencies, runtime architecture, and unrelated performance workloads are unchanged.
- Risks: The free orbit is intentionally turntable-like and preserves the camera up vector, matching the app's main-canvas orbit. A future request for unconstrained roll would require an explicit trackball interaction mode.

### Iteration 8 — Direct pointer tracking for the orientation point

- Request: Make the grabbed orientation point move immediately with the mouse because the previous gesture required a large pointer drag for a small point movement.
- Task type: Tier 3 interaction-sensitivity diagnosis, custom canvas-handle direct-manipulation correction, camera-math extension, acceptance strengthening, and targeted performance verification.
- User-visible result: A grabbed axis point now stays directly beneath the pointer inside the orientation sphere. An 18×18px diagonal pointer drag moves the point 17.324×17.324px to the circular boundary instead of only 1.13×1.13px; click snap and the 3px click/drag threshold are unchanged.
- Source/reference checked: The running local app, its current `view.orbit` pose and axis projections, the previous viewport-height-scaled gesture, the 70px gizmo geometry, and controlled-browser pointer measurements before and after the correction.
- Reference inputs: None; no new external reference asset was supplied for this interaction-sensitivity pass.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, decision contract, core control/layout/runtime/performance modules, custom-controls, component rules, acceptance, renderer-technique, app performance docs, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Map the absolute gizmo-local pointer coordinate onto the 24.5px orientation sphere and compute the camera quaternion that projects the grabbed world-axis endpoint to that mapped coordinate. Preserve the endpoint's starting front/rear hemisphere during the gesture, preserve camera radius, and rotate the camera up vector when required for exact two-axis tracking.
- Root cause: The prior shared turntable formula used `angle = π × delta / viewportHeight`. At a measured 1228px viewport height, its angular change projected an 18px pointer delta to only 1.13px on the 24.5px gizmo radius, even though rendering and pointer event delivery were responsive.
- Alternatives rejected: A fixed sensitivity multiplier because it remains approximate and varies nonlinearly around the sphere; continuing to divide by viewport height because it couples a compact handle to unrelated layout size; scaling by the gizmo diameter alone because it improves speed but does not keep the selected point under the pointer; changing main-canvas orbit sensitivity because the reported mismatch is isolated to the gizmo.
- State/output mapping: `orientation-gizmo-control.tsx` captures the active endpoint and hemisphere and writes direct pointer poses through the existing merged `view.orbit` history group; `orbit-camera.ts` converts pointer coordinates to camera position/up; preview, export, reset, and undo/redo continue to consume the unchanged runtime target.
- Files changed: direct gizmo orbit math and tests, orientation handle gesture, schema help, acceptance/reference metadata, performance observable text, browser acceptance, implementation plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check` passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 265 Vitest tests; focused camera/effects browser acceptance passed; targeted `browser perf: view.orbit remains responsive` passed its existing budgets. Controlled-browser measurement confirmed an 18×18px mouse movement produces the exact clamped 17.324×17.324px point projection and preserves the 23.040 camera radius.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working Tier 3 interaction correction. The touched `view.orbit` path ran focused functional and performance checks; export, media, dependencies, runtime architecture, and unrelated renderer workloads are unchanged.
- Risks: Pointer positions beyond the circular orientation sphere intentionally clamp to its edge; this preserves a valid spherical direction. The gizmo may introduce camera roll to maintain exact point tracking, while plain left drag on the main product canvas remains the existing turntable orbit.

### Iteration 9 — Stable gizmo backing during drag

- Request: Fix the circular orientation-gizmo backing flashing while the point is dragged.
- Task type: Tier 3 custom Canvas2D handle visual-regression diagnosis, render-layer correction, acceptance strengthening, and targeted browser/performance verification.
- User-visible result: The 70px circular backing remains a constant solid black in dark mode or solid light neutral in light mode while axes and points move above it; drag tracking, click snap, placement, size, and export exclusion are unchanged.
- Source/reference checked: The running local app, 198 pre-fix drag samples of DOM continuity and Canvas2D alpha, the orientation-gizmo drawing path, and 199 post-fix samples of computed background, element opacity, and DOM identity.
- Reference inputs: None; no new external reference asset was supplied for this visual-regression pass.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, decision contract, core control/layout/runtime/performance modules, custom-controls, component rules, acceptance, renderer-technique, performance docs, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Keep axes, dots, and hover strokes in the transparent Canvas2D bitmap, but move the circular backing to the canvas element's CSS background with `border-radius: 50%` and fully opaque theme colors. This creates one stable compositor layer that is not cleared or redrawn for every camera pose.
- Root cause: Pre-fix sampling proved the canvas was never replaced or disconnected and never cleared to alpha zero. Its background pixel remained alpha `204/255` because the circle used `rgba(..., 0.8)`, so rapidly changing WebGL pixels underneath modulated the circle's visible brightness and appeared as flashing.
- Alternatives rejected: Forcing extra redraws because the bitmap was already continuously present; remount prevention because zero replacements were measured; throttling camera updates because it would reduce direct tracking; making the backing opaque only during drag because pointer down/up would create its own brightness pulse; lowering WebGL quality because the product renderer was not the faulty layer.
- State/output mapping: `orientation-gizmo-control.tsx` now owns a stable opaque CSS backing and redraws only transparent axis graphics; runtime `view.orbit`, history, preview, export, reset, point math, and the WebGL renderer are unchanged. Browser acceptance verifies the opaque computed color around the same drag that proves output change and direct point tracking.
- Files changed: orientation-gizmo drawing/style, camera/effects browser acceptance, visual-stability plan, acceptance observable metadata, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check` passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 265 Vitest tests; focused camera/effects browser acceptance passed; targeted `browser perf: view.orbit remains responsive` passed its existing budgets. Controlled-browser slow-drag sampling returned 199/199 samples with one background color `rgb(0, 0, 0)`, opacity `1`, zero disconnections, and zero DOM replacements.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working Tier 3 visual fix. The touched handle and `view.orbit` path ran functional, visual, and targeted performance checks; export, media, dependencies, runtime architecture, and unrelated workloads are unchanged.
- Risks: The backing is intentionally opaque, so WebGL content no longer shows faintly through the orientation circle. This is the necessary compositing change that removes flashing and matches the supplied element's solid-black appearance.

### Iteration 10 — Physically separated gizmo circle and axes surface

- Request: Correct the remaining flicker of the circle itself; the prior opaque CSS background on the Canvas element did not remove the visible defect.
- Task type: Tier 3 corrected visual-regression diagnosis, custom-handle compositing split, browser acceptance update, and targeted performance verification.
- User-visible result: The circle is now a dedicated memoized 70×70 DOM layer that never shares pixels or reconciliation work with the transparent 70×70 / 140×140-backing Canvas2D axes surface above it. Camera drag can redraw the axes without touching the circle.
- Source/reference checked: The running local app after the prior fix, the shared canvas/CSS compositing structure, the user's explicit clarification that the circle still flickered, and controlled-browser sampling of the new two-layer DOM structure during slow drag.
- Reference inputs: None; no new external reference asset was supplied for this corrected visual-regression pass.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, decision contract, core control/layout/runtime/performance modules, custom-controls, component rules, acceptance, renderer-technique, performance docs, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Portal two absolute sibling layers at identical bottom/left/size coordinates. A pointer-inert memoized backing `div` owns the solid theme color at z-index 20; the interactive transparent Canvas2D handle owns axes, dots, pointer capture, and `data-toolcraft-canvas-handle` at z-index 21. The backing is paint-contained and does not rerender when `view.orbit` changes.
- Corrected root cause: The previous pass proved CSS values were stable but left the background and dynamic bitmap on the same canvas element. That evidence could not rule out replacement of the browser's composited canvas surface. Physical sibling separation removes that shared surface instead of relying on computed-style stability.
- Alternatives rejected: Keeping the background on the canvas element because the user verified it still flickered; throttling pose updates because it would break direct point tracking; drawing the entire gizmo as DOM because Canvas2D already provides compact depth-sorted axes efficiently; changing WebGL quality because the circle is an editing overlay; hiding the circle during drag because it contradicts the requested control.
- State/output mapping: `OrientationGizmoBacking` is visual-only and memoized by theme. The sibling Canvas continues to write the unchanged `view.orbit` runtime target through the same history group; preview, export, reset, click snap, point tracking, and export exclusion remain unchanged. Browser acceptance now proves both layers have identical bounds, the backing is opaque, and the axes canvas is transparent.
- Files changed: orientation-gizmo compositing structure, camera/effects browser acceptance, separated-backing plan, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check` passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 265 Vitest tests; focused camera/effects browser acceptance passed. Controlled-browser slow drag collected 194 samples with identical `70×70` backing/canvas bounds, one constant backing color, backing opacity `1`, transparent canvas background, and zero node changes for either layer. The first software-WebGL targeted `view.orbit` perf run had one transient 183.5ms frame-gap miss; an immediate identical rerun passed the unchanged 90ms/650ms/180ms scenario budgets, while the preferred controlled-browser interaction remained stable.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working Tier 3 visual correction. The touched handle/compositor and `view.orbit` path ran functional, controlled-browser, and targeted performance checks; export, media, dependencies, runtime architecture, and unrelated workloads are unchanged.
- Risks: The fallback software-WebGL runner can produce isolated frame-gap variance during full-resolution camera invalidation, as recorded rather than hidden. The separate circle layer itself is static, memoized, and no longer participates in Canvas2D redraws.

### Iteration 11 — Mesh FX identity and independent base scene

- Request: Remove copied product traces, rename the app and implementation identifiers, and make the result read as a custom product.
- Task type: Tier 4 product debranding, schema/settings/export identity migration, WebGL base-scene redesign, dependency removal, artifact cleanup, acceptance update, browser verification, and final regression gate.
- User-visible result: The app is now Mesh FX Lab with a Mesh FX controls panel, `mesh-fx` settings/export identity, neutral built-in-model copy, and an independently lit ring model. Effects, upload, left-button orbit, Blender-style gizmo, render scale, Toolcraft shell, no-timeline policy, and PNG/JPG delivery remain available.
- Source/reference checked: Current local source tree, product schema, package/settings/export identifiers, browser DOM, WebGL canvas, console, model loader, renderer pipeline, acceptance/performance matrices, and the running app at `http://127.0.0.1:3003/`.
- Reference inputs: Existing mandatory reference-study evidence already recorded in this worklog and `src/app/acceptance/defaults.ts`; no new external visual or behavior reference was supplied for this pass.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, reference study, runtime boundary, assembly workflow, schema reference, setup/export, decision contract, renderer technique, acceptance, core/app performance docs, and required brainstorming, writing-plans, systematic-debugging, and browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `canvas-no-app-ui`, `canvas-surface-preserved`, `controls-product-coverage`, `output-export-required`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Rebrand every product-facing identity atomically as Mesh FX Lab; change package/app/settings/export/DOM identifiers together; generate the studio environment locally from six custom emissive panels convolved by PMREM; independently tune camera, ring geometry, material, and key light; remove the gain-map dependency and all runtime network access to the inspected host; keep mandatory license, notice, reference-study, feature-inventory, and historical worklog provenance truthful.
- Alternatives rejected: Deleting or falsifying required provenance and legal notices because that would violate the project contract; rehosting the same external environment image because that would preserve the copied asset and dependency; keeping the remote URL because it remained visible in Network/console and could fail independently; changing effect controls, upload, orbit, gizmo, export, or Toolcraft shell because the request targets identity and provenance rather than those product behaviors.
- State/output mapping: `app-schema.ts` owns the Mesh FX settings identity and visible panel copy; `studio-environment.ts` creates one cached local PMREM texture; `scene-profile.ts` and `model-loader.ts` define the custom built-in scene; `three-effects-engine.ts` feeds that scene into the existing effect graph; `effects-canvas.tsx` exposes neutral `mesh-fx`/`default` observables; `panel-actions.ts` downloads `mesh-fx-{resolution}` output.
- Files changed: package manifest/lockfile, HTML identity, schema, panel action, renderer canvas/engine/profile/model loader, new procedural studio environment, renderer/acceptance/performance tests and matrices, product browser tests, current implementation plan, gitignore, cleanup artifacts, and this worklog.
- Verification: `npm run ai:check`, typecheck, focused 40-test renderer/product group, and `npm run verify:quick` passed with 52 files and 265 Vitest tests. Focused PNG export acceptance passed and verified `mesh-fx-2k.png`; the targeted worst-case WebGL preview scenario passed. Agent-browser verification confirmed the Mesh FX Lab identity, custom lit ring, 5120×2880 Resolution ×2 backing, ASCII selection, left-drag orbit state change, 70×70 separated gizmo layers, and a clean post-fix warning/error console. `npm run verify:final` then passed all 265 Vitest tests, the production build, and 21 non-performance Playwright browser tests.
- Skipped checks: The full performance checkpoint is not required for this post-first-working debranding pass because the user did not report a performance regression. The touched environment initialization and full-resolution preview path ran the targeted worst-case WebGL scenario. Timeline, layers, video, and persistence reload remain inapplicable by product contract.
- Risks: Existing settings JSON files created under the old app id will not import under the new Mesh FX Lab identity; this is an intentional clean identity boundary. The custom procedural environment intentionally changes exact base-scene reflections while retaining multiple highlight/shadow bands. Single-file glTF sidecars remain unsupported; GLB and embedded glTF are reliable.

### Iteration 12 — Stable grabbed endpoint at the sphere boundary

- Request: Remove the remaining flicker of the colored circle when an orientation-gizmo point is held and rotated through specific positions, using the supplied `CleanShot 2026-07-13 at 11.09.02@2x.png` as the reported state.
- Task type: Tier 3 custom canvas-handle visual-regression diagnosis, boundary camera-math correction, observable browser regression coverage, and targeted `view.orbit` performance verification.
- User-visible result: A grabbed colored endpoint now keeps one stable front/rear hemisphere, opacity, and depth order when the pointer reaches or moves beyond the orientation sphere. Direct tracking, click snap, 70px design, separated backing, camera radius, history, preview, and export behavior are unchanged.
- Source/reference checked: The user-supplied 170×172 screenshot; the running local app; `orientation-gizmo-control.tsx`; `orbit-camera.ts`; repeated numerical pose projection; current Canvas2D front/rear styling; focused Playwright alpha sampling; and a controlled-browser held-point drag at the exact failing boundary.
- Reference inputs: supplied 170×172 PNG still identified by local media id `media_yTOV9MkCEA`; only this still image and the running local app were used.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, decision contract, core control/layout/runtime/performance modules, custom-controls, component rules, acceptance, renderer-technique, app performance docs, and required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Root cause: Outside-pointer projection clamped the radial coordinate to exactly `1`, which made the captured camera-local Z exactly zero. Reapplying the same bottom-edge pose alternated projected depth between `-2.22e-16` and `+2.22e-16`; `drawGizmo` consequently alternated the same point between front alpha `0.95` and rear alpha `0.3` and also changed its sort order even though the camera orientation was visually unchanged.
- Decision: Keep a minimum signed camera-local Z magnitude of `1e-4` and clamp radial length to `sqrt(1 - 1e-8)`. This preserves the captured pointer-down hemisphere throughout the gesture while moving the visual endpoint only about `1.225e-7` CSS pixels inward, far below any displayable distance. Keep the existing front/rear paint rules and correct their unstable mathematical input.
- Alternatives rejected: Another backing/compositor change because the static sibling backing remained connected and the failing pixels were the colored endpoint; forcing the active point permanently front-facing because it would mask incorrect hemisphere state and depth ordering; adding a paint-only zero epsilon because it would leave the pose singularity; throttling pointer updates because it would reintroduce lag; lowering preview resolution because the defect is independent of WebGL quality.
- State/output mapping: `orbitPoseFromGizmoPointer` maps the pointer to a stable signed sphere direction and writes the unchanged `view.orbit` runtime target through the existing merged history group. `projectOrbitAxes` then produces stable depth for the unchanged Canvas2D drawing pass; Three preview, PNG export, reset, undo/redo, and settings transfer continue to consume the same pose shape.
- Files changed: `src/app/renderer/orbit-camera.ts`, `src/app/renderer/orbit-camera.test.ts`, `e2e/app-controls.spec.ts`, `docs/plans/2026-07-13-gizmo-endpoint-flicker.md`, and this worklog.
- Verification: The focused orbit suite passed 9 tests, including 30 repeated edge projections for both captured hemispheres. An exhaustive diagnostic over 6 axes, 2 hemispheres, 360 boundary angles, and 40 repeated updates recorded zero front/rear flips with minimum absolute depth `0.00009999999999898979`. `npm run verify:quick` passed 52 files and 266 Vitest tests. Focused `browser: effect baseline and camera orbit` passed and sampled 12 held boundary frames with one constant alpha above 200. The controlled browser captured 56 active samples with one depth sign, minimum absolute depth `0.00009999999999992971`, zero sign changes, a continuously connected backing, visible output, and zero console errors. The first cold software-WebGL `browser perf: view.orbit remains responsive` run had one transient `133.4ms` frame-gap miss against the unchanged `90ms` budget; the immediate identical warmed rerun passed without changing code, quality, or budgets.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working, narrowly scoped Tier 3 visual interaction fix. The affected camera/gizmo acceptance and targeted performance paths ran; media, export bytes, dependencies, timeline, layers, persistence, and unrelated renderer workloads are unchanged.
- Risks: None for visible geometry: the `1.225e-7` CSS-pixel boundary inset is not rasterizable, while the non-zero signed depth removes the numerical ambiguity. The known software-WebGL cold-frame variance is recorded rather than hidden and is unrelated to the constant-time boundary arithmetic.

### Iteration 13 — Independent duotone preset naming

- Request: Replace the remaining preset names shown in the supplied dropdown still while retaining the existing effects and behavior.
- Task type: Tier 2 schema/product-behavior naming change covering visible select options, runtime preset identifiers, defaults, fallbacks, conditional manual-color state, acceptance, and browser verification.
- User-visible result: The duotone preset menu now uses the independent set `Manual`, `Monochrome`, `Aurora`, `Fjord`, `Paper Moon`, `Rosette`, `Deep Sea`, `Riviera`, `Prism`, `Nocturne`, `Carbon`, `Tidepool`, `Terra`, `Voltage`, `Lichen`, `Saffron`, `Beacon`, `Grove`, and `Eclipse`. Preset order, color pairs, preview output, overlay behavior, and randomization behavior are unchanged.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied 568×1112 dropdown still, the running local app, the preset catalog, schema defaults and visibility branches, renderer fallbacks, randomize action, unit coverage, and real browser output.
- Reference inputs: supplied 568×1112 PNG still identified by local media id `media_ETvGNcoE4Z`; the current local implementation is the behavioral source for the preserved color mappings.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core control-selection and layout modules, schema reference, component rules, acceptance testing, and the required brainstorming, writing-plans, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `controls-layout-heuristics`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Rename both user-facing labels and persisted runtime values so the product owns one coherent naming system. Keep all hex pairs in their previous order, set `Monochrome` as the duotone default, use `Manual` for editable colors, and update every schema, renderer, overlay, and randomize fallback to the new ids.
- Alternatives rejected: Label-only aliases because old identifiers would remain in production state and settings output; changing colors together with names because the request targeted naming and would unnecessarily alter the established visual effects; retaining compatibility aliases because that would preserve the obsolete vocabulary in runtime code.
- State/output mapping: The preset select writes the new ids into the existing duotone and overlay targets. `resolveEffectPreset` maps those ids to the unchanged ink/paper hex pairs, while `manual` keeps the existing user-selected colors. Renderer and panel-action fallbacks now use `monochrome` or `manual` without changing the render pipeline.
- Files changed: `src/app/effect-presets.ts`, `src/app/effect-presets.test.ts`, `src/app/app-schema.ts`, `src/app/renderer/effect-state.ts`, `src/app/panel-actions.ts`, `e2e/app-controls.spec.ts`, `docs/plans/2026-07-13-duotone-preset-renaming.md`, and this worklog.
- Verification: Focused preset, schema, and renderer tests passed 23 tests. The focused real-UI Playwright scenario passed and proved that selecting `Aurora` changes rendered output. Controlled-browser verification confirmed `Manual`, `Aurora`, and `Eclipse`, confirmed `Classic` and `Graphite Clay` are absent, selected `Aurora` with `aria-selected=true`, restored defaults, and recorded zero console errors. `npm run typecheck` passed, and `npm run verify:quick` passed 53 files and 268 Vitest tests.
- Skipped checks: The full performance checkpoint and `npm run verify:final` are not required for this post-first-working Tier 2 naming pass. Renderer workload, shader logic, canvas behavior, exports, media, dependencies, timeline, layers, and persistence policy are unchanged.
- Risks: Previously exported settings that contain the obsolete preset ids require the user to reselect a preset; this intentional compatibility break removes the old vocabulary instead of retaining hidden aliases.

### Iteration 14 — Remove the empty Model section

- Request: Delete the empty `Model` controls-panel section shown in the supplied still.
- Task type: Tier 2 schema and controls-panel normalization correction with focused camera/gizmo browser acceptance.
- User-visible result: The controls panel now shows one populated `3D model` section for model upload and no empty `Model` section. The lower-left orientation gizmo, camera orbit, snap, drag, history, reset, preview, and export behavior remain available.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied 592×154 panel still, the resolved Toolcraft schema, standalone control normalization, controls-panel section filtering and rendering, the orientation-gizmo portal renderer, the running local app, and focused browser acceptance.
- Reference inputs: supplied 592×154 PNG still identified by local media id `media_Hqnj0ss3wT`; the current running app supplied the DOM and interaction evidence.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, decision contract, core control-selection, layout, and runtime-boundary modules, custom-controls, and the required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `controls-product-coverage`, `controls-layout-heuristics`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `workflow-required`.
- Root cause: `fileDrop` has standalone section layout while `orientationGizmo` has grouped layout. Toolcraft correctly normalized their shared schema section into `3D model` and `Model`; the custom gizmo renderer then portaled all of its visual DOM to the canvas, leaving its still-valid controls-panel section with a header and no local body content.
- Decision: Explicitly keep the upload and schema-backed orientation target in one standalone section titled `3D model`. This removes the empty normalized section without patching copied runtime source, hiding a control behind an impossible condition, or changing the portal, renderer, camera math, or state model.
- Alternatives rejected: A runtime-only empty-DOM heuristic because render output cannot safely determine section ownership before mounting; an impossible `visibleWhen` condition because it would make the schema and acceptance contract dishonest; removing `view.orbit` from schema because reset and settings-transfer ownership would be weakened; moving the handle lifecycle out of the custom renderer because it is a broader Tier 3 refactor unrelated to the requested deletion.
- State/output mapping: `source.model` and `view.orbit` remain runtime-backed controls in one resolved `3D model` section. The visible fileDrop stays in the panel, `orientationGizmo` continues to portal the canvas handle, and the section reset now consistently restores both the uploaded model source and camera pose.
- Files changed: `src/app/app-schema.ts`, `src/app/app-schema.test.ts`, `src/app/acceptance/defaults.ts`, `e2e/app-controls.spec.ts`, `e2e/app-effects-performance.spec.ts`, `docs/plans/2026-07-13-remove-empty-model-section.md`, and this worklog.
- Verification: Four focused schema/acceptance files passed 12 tests. The focused `browser: effect baseline and camera orbit` Playwright scenario passed, including the new one-`3D model`/zero-`Model` assertion plus gizmo drag, snap, reset, and export-clean coverage. Controlled-browser verification found zero exact `Model` titles, one `3D model` title, one visible gizmo, one section reset, and zero console errors. `npm run typecheck` passed, and `npm run verify:quick` passed 53 files and 268 Vitest tests.
- Skipped checks: The full performance checkpoint and `npm run verify:final` are not required for this post-first-working Tier 2 panel-grouping correction. Renderer workload, camera math, viewport interaction code, export, dependencies, timeline, layers, and persistence are unchanged.
- Risks: `Reset 3D model section` now intentionally resets both source media and camera pose because those targets share one visible editing stage; global reset behavior is unchanged.

### Iteration 15 — Attached settings become the product defaults

- Request: Make the defaults match the supplied `mesh-fx-settings (1).json` settings export.
- Task type: Tier 2 schema/default-state update with reset acceptance, camera-pose coverage, browser verification, and targeted performance checks because the supplied profile enables autonomous Film Grain and Chromatic rendering.
- User-visible result: A fresh load and global reset now start with the supplied 1920×1080 profile: Dither, Blue Noise, size 1, Tidepool colors, Chromatic enabled at 0.02, Film Grain enabled at 0.41 with dynamic luminosity noise, Bloom disabled with its supplied latent values, and the supplied camera pose. The timeline remains absent as required by the product brief.
- Source/reference checked: The attached JSON settings export, all resolved schema control targets, camera defaults, renderer state mapping, app performance matrix, the running local app, reset behavior, and focused functional/performance browser scenarios.
- Reference inputs: `~/Downloads/mesh-fx-settings (1).json`; its `values`, canvas size, and render scale are the source of truth for fresh-load and reset defaults. Its generic transfer metadata is not treated as a request to add product features.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core control-selection, layout, performance, schema, component, acceptance, and the required brainstorming, writing-plans, systematic-debugging, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, `timeline-mode-choice`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Comparison: The initial target-by-target comparison found exactly ten differences: `view.orbit`, `effect.mode`, `dither.size`, `dither.pattern`, `dither.colors.preset`, `chromatic.enabled`, `chromatic.amount`, `grain.enabled`, `bloom.strength`, and `bloom.mix`. The final resolved-schema comparison against every attached `values` target reports zero differences.
- Decision: Update schema and camera defaults directly so the profile is authoritative on fresh state and reset, while preserving the existing explicit non-persistent settings-transfer policy. Keep Bloom disabled while retaining its attached hidden strength/mix values. Keep the app timeline disabled because the user explicitly excluded it and the JSON timeline block is transfer-format metadata, not a requested behavior change.
- Alternatives rejected: Auto-importing the local JSON because defaults must work without a machine-specific file; writing the profile into localStorage because persistence is intentionally disabled; changing only currently visible controls because reset must reproduce the complete file; enabling a timeline because it would contradict the product requirement.
- State/output mapping: Schema `defaultValue` entries and `DEFAULT_ORBIT_POSE` seed fresh runtime state and all reset commands. The renderer consumes the same runtime targets, so the attached Dither, Chromatic, Grain, Bloom, and camera values immediately drive preview and export without a separate local state layer.
- Files changed: `src/app/app-schema.ts`, `src/app/app-schema.test.ts`, `src/app/renderer/orbit-camera.ts`, `src/app/app-performance.ts`, `e2e/app-controls.spec.ts`, `e2e/app-effects-performance.spec.ts`, `docs/plans/2026-07-13-attached-default-settings.md`, and this worklog.
- Verification: The target-by-target schema comparison reports `differenceCount: 0`. Focused schema, orbit, effect-state, and animation-intent tests passed 38 tests. Focused browser acceptance passed for fresh defaults, global reset, effects, autonomous Grain, and camera orbit. `npm run verify:quick` passed 53 files and 269 Vitest tests. Controlled-browser verification confirmed the expected selects, section switches, exact camera attribute, Dither output, a 64ms Shift-drag with active effects, and zero console errors.
- Performance note: An additional software-WebGL Playwright fallback diagnostic was run before the controlled-browser checkpoint. Its Grain frame scenario passed, while four interaction/frame budgets remained above their hardware-browser thresholds despite isolating unrelated default effects. Because the required agent-controlled browser was available, those headless software-renderer misses are recorded as environment diagnostics rather than used to loosen product quality, defaults, or budgets.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working non-performance defaults edit. The affected defaults, reset, camera, autonomous frame, effects, viewport interaction, and performance-matrix paths received focused coverage; dependencies, runtime architecture, exports, media, layers, and timeline implementation are unchanged.
- Risks: The requested profile intentionally enables continuous Film Grain and Chromatic work on fresh load. The controlled-browser interaction stayed responsive and error-free; software-WebGL timings remain slower than hardware-backed browsing and are kept as a documented environment variance.

### Iteration 16 — Keep Film Grain animated during model rotation

- Request: Keep Film Grain running while the user rotates the 3D figure.
- Task type: Tier 3 autonomous WebGL animation and pointer-interaction correction with direct-model and orientation-gizmo browser regression coverage plus targeted interaction performance.
- User-visible result: Dynamic Film Grain now continues changing while the left mouse button is held during direct model orbit and while an orientation-gizmo point is dragged. Actual viewport pan/zoom still coalesces the non-essential Grain animation and resumes it after the interaction.
- Source/reference checked: The running local app, `effects-canvas.tsx` pointer capture and Grain render loop, Toolcraft viewport gesture ownership, orientation-gizmo event handling, renderer cache/present passes, existing Grain and `view.orbit` performance scenarios, and before/after browser pixel snapshots.
- Reference inputs: None; this pass implements the explicit behavior request against the current local product.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, core runtime-boundary, performance, and timeline-animation modules, renderer-technique, performance, acceptance-testing, decision-contract, and the required brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, project browser, and in-app browser skills.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `timeline-mode-choice`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Root cause: The autonomous Grain loop installed one capture-phase `pointerdown` listener on the entire Toolcraft viewport and set `interacting = true` for every pointer target. That capture listener ran before the model canvas or gizmo could claim and stop the orbit gesture, so Grain skipped every animation frame until `pointerup`. A focused browser regression reproduced the freeze as two byte-identical WebGL snapshots while the orbit pointer remained held.
- Decision: Classify pointer ownership before suspending Grain. Unmodified left drag on the effects canvas and any orientation-gizmo drag remain autonomous-product interactions and keep Grain frames running. Blank-viewport left drag plus Shift/Ctrl/Meta-modified product-canvas drag remain Toolcraft viewport interactions and retain the existing suspension/resume optimization; wheel behavior is unchanged.
- Alternatives rejected: Removing interaction throttling globally because real viewport pan/zoom should still yield non-essential animation work; forcing a full scene rerender on every Grain frame because the existing cached animated composer already presents Grain without rebuilding model/environment resources; waiting until pointerup to update orbit because it would break direct manipulation; lowering render scale or Grain quality because the bug was event classification, not GPU fidelity.
- State/output mapping: `grain.dynamic` and `grain.enabled` continue to own the autonomous frame loop. Pointer classification only controls whether `renderAnimated` is skipped during a viewport-owned interaction; `view.orbit` continues through runtime history/state and static scene-cache invalidation, while the cached animated composer keeps presenting Film Grain during model-owned orbit gestures.
- Files changed: `src/app/renderer/effects-canvas.tsx`, `src/app/renderer/grain-interaction.ts`, `src/app/renderer/grain-interaction.test.ts`, `e2e/app-controls.spec.ts`, `docs/plans/2026-07-14-film-grain-during-orbit.md`, and this worklog.
- Verification: The new classifier passed 7 focused cases; renderer source coverage plus classifier coverage passed 14 tests. `npm run typecheck` passed. The focused pre-fix reproduction recorded identical held-pointer WebGL hashes; after the correction, the same test passed for both direct model orbit and orientation-gizmo orbit. `npm run verify:quick` passed 54 files and 276 Vitest tests. Agent-browser stress verification set Grain to its declared maximum 1 at Resolution scale 2, changed orbit in 67ms, kept the WebGL output visible, preserved the separate 71ms Shift-pan path, restored defaults, and recorded zero console/WebGL errors.
- Skipped checks: `npm run verify:final` and the full performance checkpoint are not required for this post-first-working non-performance interaction correction. The affected autonomous Grain, direct orbit, gizmo orbit, viewport pan, render-scale stress, and responsiveness paths received focused browser/performance coverage; exports, media, dependencies, runtime architecture, controls, timeline, layers, and persistence are unchanged.
- Risks: None for the requested interaction. Dynamic Grain now consumes its normal cached present pass during model rotation by design; the scene/model pass remains cached and actual canvas viewport movement retains its interaction throttle.

## Evidence

- Source reviewed: Morflax live route, its Effects/UI and Three.js/effects Nuxt bundles, `src/app/app-schema.ts`, renderer files, export handler, acceptance matrix, performance matrix, and real browser output.
- Contract applied: Toolcraft workflow, reference study, runtime boundary, setup/export, media upload, renderer technique, acceptance, and performance rules.
- Evidence: Historical reference observations are preserved in the typed `appTransferMode.referenceStudy`, its feature inventory, and the Decision Trail above; removed one-off network captures and obsolete parity plans are not production dependencies.

- Run after applying the attached default settings: full target-by-target schema comparison reported zero differences; focused defaults/reset/effects/Grain/camera browser acceptance passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed 53 files and 269 Vitest tests; controlled-browser verification confirmed the live Dither/Blue Noise/Tidepool/Chromatic/Film Grain profile, the exact orbit pose, a 64ms active-effects viewport drag, and zero console errors.
- Run after continuous Film Grain orbit correction: focused held-pointer browser acceptance passed for direct model and orientation-gizmo rotation; `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run verify:quick` passed 54 files and 276 Vitest tests; agent-browser maximum-Grain orbit completed in 67ms, Shift-pan completed in 71ms, output remained visible, defaults restored, and zero console/WebGL errors were recorded.

- Browser: orientation gizmo measured 70×70 CSS / 140×140 backing with 16px lower-left viewport insets; click snap, free two-axis point drag, stable pose after release, fixed zoom placement, PNG exclusion, and zero application/WebGL errors were verified.
- Browser: performance checkpoint runner agent-browser — Pixelate switch completed in 912ms including a 350ms settle; three real toolbar zoom actions completed in 769ms; output stayed visible and selected effect state remained stable.

## Risks

- Risk: Single-file glTF import cannot resolve external sidecar resources; GLB and embedded glTF are the reliable upload formats.
- Risk: The reference is a live deployment and may change after the inspected source snapshot.
- None: No unresolved required verification blocker is recorded.

### Iteration 17 — Canonical Toolcraft demo subpath

- User-visible result: The production build and Vercel deployment now serve the app at `/demos/ascii/`, including nested client routes and all bundled assets.
- Contract applied: The Vite base and TanStack Router base path share `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`; local development remains rooted at `/`, while build and preview use the canonical prefix.
- Verification tier: Tier 2. `npm run build`, `npm run verify:quick` (54 files, 276 tests), and a browser load through the website rewrite all passed. The browser retained the Toolcraft URL, rendered one app shell and runtime canvas, and reported no application console errors or non-favicon 4xx responses.

#### Thermo-nuclear review remediation

- Result: Vercel now routes generated assets before the final SPA fallback, so direct non-file descendants receive the application HTML without breaking prefixed assets.
- Verification: the exhaustive four-test gateway contract, production build, canonical root browser load, and `/demos/ascii/review-deep-link` reload passed with `200 text/html` and no asset errors. The existing quick-gate result above remains current because this pass changes deployment routing only.

### Iteration 18 — Shared Toolcraft social preview

- User-visible result: Social shares of the app now use the main Toolcraft 1200×630 preview image through Open Graph and Twitter metadata.
- Source and contract: `apps/website/public/social-previews/og-toolcraft-v2.jpg` remains the single asset source. The metadata uses its absolute `https://toolcraft.sh/` URL so neither the `/demos/ascii/` Vite base nor a direct Vercel hostname can rewrite it incorrectly.
- Verification tier: Tier 0. Product schema, runtime state, renderer, canvas, exports, and performance are unchanged. The repository metadata contract, production build, built-HTML base-path inspection, website typecheck/build, starter tests/typecheck, CLI generation tests, and Frozen signed integrity check passed; production verification follows the pushed commit.
